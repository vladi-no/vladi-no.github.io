            <!-- Jira / Atlassian -->
            <section>
                <h3>Jira Issue Assignment Intelligence – Atlassian</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of the Jira development team in Amsterdam I worked on core product
                    features and reliability, and helped explore how AI could make teams faster.
                    I built an early prototype of an AI-powered assignee suggestion system that
                    analysed issue history, team structure and workload to recommend the most
                    suitable person for a new ticket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The work combined Jira’s existing workflows with lightweight machine learning
                    models and careful UX so that suggestions felt helpful rather than intrusive,
                    and always kept humans in control of the final decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tech:</strong> Java, Jira platform APIs, internal data services,
                    ML experimentation (Python), collaborative product design with PMs and designers.
                </p>

            <!-- ERP systems -->
            <section>
                <h3>ERP and Operations Platforms – Bizboard, Sunvigo, SpotmyEnergy</h3>
                <p>
                    For several companies in the Netherlands and Germany I’ve helped design and build
                    ERP-style systems that tie together sales, operations, billing and technical data.
                    The goal in each case was the same: fewer manual steps, less copy-pasting and more
                    reliable, traceable processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has included extending existing systems and building new services around them,
                    integrating data from CRMs, energy devices and external partners, and giving teams
                    simple tools that reflect how they actually work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tech:</strong> Python (including Odoo), TypeScript, PostgreSQL, data pipelines,
                    REST APIs, containerised services (Docker/Kubernetes).
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Native mobile apps -->
            <section>
                <h3>Native Mobile Apps for Dutch Companies</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the years I have built and maintained native Android and iOS applications
                    for several companies in the Netherlands, ranging from small tools to more complex,
                    data-driven apps. The focus has always been fast, smooth experiences and clean
                    integration with back-end services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Early work involved Java and Objective-C, later moving to Swift and modern Android
                    tooling. In all cases the apps were closely aligned with the client’s workflows and
                    branding rather than generic templates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tech:</strong> Java (Android), Objective-C, Swift, REST/JSON APIs,
                    authentication flows, app store delivery.
                </p>

            <!-- Sunvigo multi-platform app -->
            <section>
                <h3>Solar Monitoring App – Sunvigo GmbH</h3>
                <p>
                    At Sunvigo I worked on a multi-platform mobile application that lets customers
                    monitor their solar production and household consumption in real time, view their
                    history and adjust key settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal was to make renewable energy usage feel transparent and approachable:
                    clear graphs, simple controls and a robust backend that stayed responsive even
                    with many customers online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tech:</strong> Flutter, Quarkus, REST APIs, authentication, monitoring and logging.

            <!-- Low-resource language speech model -->
            <section>
                <h3>Speech Models for Low-Resource Languages</h3>
                <p>
                    Together with colleagues from VU Amsterdam and partner organisations I built and
                    evaluated an AI system that can learn a language word-by-word from native speakers,
                    even when only a small number of speech samples are available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a proof of concept we supported Twi (Ghana) and Bambara (Mali), showing that
                    communities don’t need massive datasets to start building useful speech technology
                    in their own language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tech:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, speech processing, data collection tooling,
                    evaluation pipelines.
                </p>
                <p>

            </section>

            <!-- Medical imaging AI -->
            <section>
                <h3>Medical Imaging Triage Models – VUmc Amsterdam</h3>
                <p>
                    In collaboration with VU Amsterdam and VUmc I contributed to machine learning
                    pipelines that analyse medical images such as MRI, CT and X-ray scans and flag
                    cases that may deserve extra attention from clinicians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The focus was not to replace radiologists, but to prioritise suspicious cases,
                    reduce the chance of missed findings and support over-stretched hospital teams
                    with consistent, explainable signals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tech:</strong> Python, deep learning frameworks, image preprocessing,
                    training and evaluation workflows, clinical collaboration.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Psychological Coaching Website – Leonie Wittkamp</h3>
                <p>
                    Designed and implemented a calm, welcoming brochure site for a psychological coach,
                    focusing on clear structure, warm visuals and a frictionless contact flow for
                    potential clients.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    Built an author site for Leonie’s historical novel, with book presentation, events,
                    contact and a subtle dark-gold visual theme inspired by the Orient Express motif
                    in the story.
